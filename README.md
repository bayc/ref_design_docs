# Reference Hybrid System Designs

## Introduction
This repository is intended to house reference hybrid system designs created at NREL. We hope that by hosting these designs on a public repository we will encourage and facilitate collaboration on these designs so they can be improved and refined through external input and use. If you are interested in using these designs, we hope you find them useful and ask that you properly reference this repository.

For instructions on how to use the reference designs, for more information on the designs themselves, or for
information on how to contribute/provide feedback for the repository, please refer to the
[documentation](https://bayc.github.io/ref_design_docs/).
