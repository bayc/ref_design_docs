## Introduction
This repository is intended to house reference hybrid system designs created at NREL. We hope that
by hosting these designs on a public repository we will encourage and facilitate collaboration on
these designs so they can be improved and refined through external input and use.

If you are interested in using these designs, we hope you find them useful and ask that you
properly reference this repository (citation widget available on the GitHub repository page).

For detailed information about the designs themselves, please refer to the [User Guide](user_guide/user_guide.md) and the
[reference design report](user_guide/Reference_Design_Documentation.pdf).

If you are interested in contributing, please following the developers guide provided below.
